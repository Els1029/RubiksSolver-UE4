# RubiksSolver-UE4

This is the outcome of my final year project

Unreal Engine 4.27.2

It uses OpenCV 4.5.5 so the .dll and .lib files can be found here: https://opencv.org/releases/

This tutorial was used to set up OpenCV:  https://codeantenna.com/a/5lhdFRk9hf

The implmentation included Android files however, Android is not working correctly

To build, right click on the project file and click build project.
